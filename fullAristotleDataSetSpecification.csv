<p>Income tests are usually designed with a &rsquo;free area&rsquo;<strong>&mdash;</strong>&nbsp;the amount of income someone can have before the income test applies. The free area recognises that people need to use their wages to cover the costs of working before they can spend earnings on other needs. For unearned income, a free area allows a recipient to hold modest savings without affecting their payments (unless they have other income).</p>

<p>Income tests also have a &lsquo;taper rate&#39;<strong>&mdash;</strong>the amount by which payments reduce for every extra dollar of income received in excess of the free area. The taper rate is a compromise between the goal of reducing government assistance and recognising greater self reliance on one hand, while on the other hand maintaining a reward for working. When income falls, the taper rate dictates what proportion of the income will be replaced by income support or family payments.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;cut out&rsquo; is the income at which payments are reduced to zero when people cease to receive income support.</p>

<p>Income banking arrangements allow people to save (or &rsquo;bank credits&#39; for periods when they have little or no earnings to offset earnings at a later date).</p>

<p><strong>Assets&nbsp;tests</strong></p>

<p>Assets tests are intended to ensure people with high assets draw on their savings to meet their current needs. Assets tests usually have a threshold and a taper rate.</p>

<p>Non-homeowners have a higher assets test threshold than homeowners, but the principal home is exempt from the assets test.</p>

<p>The assets test limit is set at the value of the assets test threshold for Newstart Allowance and Parenting Payment (Single) (that is&nbsp;there is no taper) resulting in a &lsquo;sudden death&rsquo; limit whereby recipients lose their payment entirely if they have assets above the threshold.</p>",,

Business also wants to capture data on re-grants within 18 weeks after cancellation for comparison/trends.  

Report each instance where payment type NSA, SPL, YAL JS, PPS and PPP has been cancelled for one of the following reasons:

   	CDR = Customer failed to re-engage
   	TCF = Did not meet provider requirement(contingency if CDR/DCP cancellation process fails)
   	TCW = Provider Work refusal Failure(contingency if CDR/DCP cancellation process fails)
   	TCP - (if 3rd MOF applied)
   	TCU     Unemployment Failure Penalty

NB: CDR is both a TCF and JSM cancellation 

A re-grant should be reported in the following circumstances:
1.	Payment is restored/re-granted where a    TCP   ,    TCU   ,    CDR,   ,    TCP   ,    TCW    cancellation has been removed and replaced by another cancellation reason with the same DOE or an earlier DOE

The recording of an RQ code allows for partnered customers to be paid at the single rate of payment due to their current circumstances, in line with policy requirements. When an RQ is recorded, no end date can be recorded at the same time. Rather, Service Officers (SOs) need to set up a Manual Review activity (RVR) to review the customer   s circumstances at a scheduled review date and determine whether to continue or end the RQ coding.  Failing to record, or subsequently act on a Manual Review that falls due, results in the RQ code remaining on the record with no further prompts to initiate a review.  
It is a host system decision regarding how the presence of a RQ code is applied i.e. each payment stream   s system rules define how the RQ code is used in determining rates of entitlement.",7089da98b44c11ea849a5a0bdf2d1ed7,123,,MI5436 Relationship Qualifier code Tech Spec V0.1,,,"Columns needed:
